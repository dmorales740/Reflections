Lesson 2

1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a meta data folder in the directory that begins to track the files and makes them available for commits.

Files from the working directory are placed in the staging area before they are commited to a repository. I allows us to preview the repository before it is created.
